# COOL-compiler
Lexer, Parser and semantic analyzer for COOL programming language

## Lexer
You can check main Lexer's code (code that I've written) in cool.flex file. All the other files are support files needed for Lexer to run properly, and files used for testing.
To start and test Lexer run these commands:
1. make lexer
2. make lexer_test
3. ./lexer_test

This will check all of lexer's abilities and give you back test results and a grade.

## Parser
You can check main Parser's code (code that I've written) in cool.y file. All the other files are support files needed for Parser to run properly, and files used for testing.
To start and test Parser run these commands:
1. make parser
2. make parser_test
3. ./parser_test

This will check all of parser's abilities and give you back test results and a grade.
